abstract: In this article we present an ongoing effort to formalise quantum algorithms
  and results in quantum information theory using the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.
  Formal methods being critical for the safety and security of algorithms and protocols,
  we foresee their widespread use for quantum computing in the future. We have developed
  a large library for quantum computing in Isabelle based on a matrix representation
  for quantum circuits, successfully formalising the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation,
  Deutsch's algorithm, the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.
  We discuss the design choices made and report on an outcome of our work in the field
  of quantum game theory.
