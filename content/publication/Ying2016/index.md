abstract: Foundations of Quantum Programming discusses how new programming methodologies
  and technologies developed for current computers can be extended to exploit the
  unique power of quantum computers, which promise dramatic advantages in processing
  speed over currently available computer systems. Governments and industries around
  the globe are now investing vast amounts of money with the expectation of building
  practical quantum computers. Drawing upon years of experience and research in quantum
  computing research and using numerous examples and illustrations, Mingsheng Ying
  has created a very useful reference on quantum programming languages and important
  tools and techniques required for quantum programming, making the book a valuable
  resource for academics, researchers, and developers.
