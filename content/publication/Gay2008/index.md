abstract: The novel field of quantum computation and quantum information has been
  growing at a rapid rate; the study of quantum information in particular has led
  to the emergence of communication and cryptographic protocols with no classical
  analogues. Quantum information protocols have interesting properties which are not
  exhibited by their classical counterparts, but they are most distinguished for their
  applications in cryptography. Notable results include the unconditional security
  proof [1] of quantum key distribution. This result, in particular, is one of the
  reasons for the widespread interest in this field. Furthermore, the implementation
  of quantum cryptography has been demonstrated in non-laboratory settings and is
  already an important practical technology. Implementations of quantum cryptography
  have already been commercially launched and tested by a number of companies including
  MagiQ, Id Quantique, Toshiba, and NEC. The unconditional security of quantum key
  distribution protocols does not automatically imply the same degree of security
  for actual systems, of course; this justifies the need for systems modelling and
  verification in this setting.
