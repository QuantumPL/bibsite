abstract: In a recent paper, a realizability technique has been used to give a semantics
  of a quantum lambda calculus. Such a technique gives rise to an infinite number
  of valid typing rules, without giving preference to any subset of those. In this
  paper, we introduce a valid subset of typing rules, defining an expressive enough
  quantum calculus. Then, we propose a categorical semantics for it. Such a semantics
  consists of an adjunction between the category of distributive-action spaces of
  value distributions (that is, linear combinations of values in the lambda calculus),
  and the category of sets of value distributions.
