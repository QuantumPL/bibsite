abstract: 'We introduce the language QML, a functional language for quantum computations
  on finite types. Its design is guided by its categorical semantics: QML programs
  are interpreted by morphisms in the category FQC of finite quantum computations,
  which provides a constructive semantics of irreversible quantum computations realisable
  as quantum gates. QML integrates reversible and irreversible quantum computations
  in one language, using first order strict linear logic to make weakenings explicit.
  Strict programs are free from decoherence and hence preserve superpositions and
  entanglement - which is essential for quantum parallelism.'
