abstract: We propose the design of a programming language for quantum computing. Traditionally,
  quantum algorithms are frequently expressed at the hardware level, for instance
  in terms of the quantum circuit model or quantum Turing machines. These approaches
  do not encourage structured programming or abstractions such as data types. In this
  paper, we describe the syntax and semantics of a simple quantum programming language
  with high-level features such as loops, recursive procedures, and structured data
  types. The language is functional in nature, statically typed, free of run-time
  errors, and has an interesting denotational semantics in terms of complete partial
  orders of superoperators.
