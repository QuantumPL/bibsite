abstract: This work is an effort to formalise some quantum algorithms and results
  in quantum information theory. Formal methods being critical for the safety and
  security of algorithms and protocols, we foresee their widespread use for quantum
  computing in the future. We have developed a large library for quantum computing
  in Isabelle based on a matrix representation for quantum circuits, successfully
  formalising the no-cloning theorem, quantum teleportation, Deutsch's algorithm,
  the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.
