abstract: With the advent of small-scale prototype quantum computers, researchers
  can now code and run quantum algorithms that were previously proposed but not fully
  implemented. In support of this growing interest in quantum computing experimentation,
  programmers need new tools and techniques to write and debug QC code. In this work,
  we implement a range of QC algorithms and programs in order to discover what types
  of bugs occur and what defenses against those bugs are possible in QC programs.
  We conduct our study by running small-sized QC programs in QC simulators in order
  to replicate published results in QC implementations. Where possible, we cross-validate
  results from programs written in different QC languages for the same problems and
  inputs. Drawing on this experience, we provide a taxonomy for QC bugs, and we propose
  QC language features that would aid in writing correct code.
