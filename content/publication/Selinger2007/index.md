abstract: Dagger compact closed categories were recently introduced by Abramsky and
  Coecke, under the name "strongly compact closed categories", as an axiomatic framework
  for quantum mechanics. We present a graphical language for dagger compact closed
  categories, and sketch a proof of its completeness for equational reasoning. We
  give a general construction, the CPM construction, which associates to each dagger
  compact closed category its "category of completely positive maps", and we show
  that the resulting category is again dagger compact closed. We apply these ideas
  to Abramsky and Coecke's interpretation of quantum protocols, and to D'Hondt and
  Panangaden's predicate transformer semantics.
