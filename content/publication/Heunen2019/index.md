abstract: Monoidal category theory serves as a powerful framework for describing logical
  aspects of quantum theory, giving an abstract language for parallel and sequential
  composition, and a conceptual way to understand many high-level quantum phenomena.
  This text lays the foundation for this categorical quantum mechanics, with an emphasis
  on the graphical calculus which makes computation intuitive. Biproducts and dual
  objects are introduced and used to model superposition and entanglement, with quantum
  teleportation studied abstractly using these structures. Monoids, Frobenius structures
  and Hopf algebras are described, and it is shown how they can be used to model classical
  information and complementary observables. The CP construction, a categorical tool
  to describe probabilistic quantum systems, is also investigated. The last chapter
  introduces higher categories, surface diagrams and 2-Hilbert spaces, and shows how
  the language of duality in monoidal 2-categories can be used to reason about quantum
  protocols, including quantum teleportation and dense coding.  Prior knowledge of
  linear algebra, quantum information or category theory would give an ideal background
  for studying this text, but it is not assumed, with essential background material
  given in a self-contained introductory chapter. Throughout the text links with many
  other areas are highlighted, such as representation theory, topology, quantum algebra,
  knot theory, and probability theory, and nonstandard models are presented, such
  as sets and relations. All results are stated rigorously, and full proofs are given
  as far as possible, making this book an invaluable reference for modern techniques
  in quantum logic, with much of the material not available in any other textbook.
