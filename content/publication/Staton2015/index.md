abstract: 'We develop a new framework of algebraic theories with linear parameters,
  and use it to analyze the equational reasoning principles of quantum computing and
  quantum programming languages. We use the framework as follows: we present a new
  elementary algebraic theory of quantum computation, built from unitary gates and
  measurement;we provide a completeness theorem or the elementary algebraic theory
  by relating it with a model from operator algebra; we extract an equational theory
  for a quantum programming language from the algebraic theory;we compare quantum
  computation with other local notions of computation by investigating variations
  on the algebraic theory.'
