abstract: 'While recent progress in quantum hardware open the door for significant
  speedup in certain key areas (cryptography, biology, chemistry, optimization, machine
  learning, etc), quantum algorithms are still hard to implement right, and the validation
  of such quantum programs is achallenge. Moreover, importing the testing and debugging
  practices at use in classical programming is extremely difficult in the quantum
  case, due to the destructive aspect of quantum measurement. As an alternative strategy,
  formal methods are prone to play a decisive role in the emerging field of quantum
  software. Recent works initiate solutions for problems occurring at every stage
  of the development process: high-level program design, implementation, compilation,
  etc. We review the induced challenges for an efficient use of formal methods in
  quantum computing and the current most promising research directions.'
