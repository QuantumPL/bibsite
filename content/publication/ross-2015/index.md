abstract: 'This thesis contains contributions to the theory of quantum computation.
  We first define a new method to efficiently approximate special unitary operators.
  Specifically, given a special unitary U and a precision ε > 0, we show how to efficiently
  find a sequence of Clifford+V or Clifford+T operators whose product approximates
  U up to ε in the operator norm. In the general case, the length of the approximating
  sequence is asymptotically optimal. If the unitary to approximate is diagonal then
  our method is optimal: it yields the shortest sequence approximating U up to ε.
  Next, we introduce a mathematical formalization of a fragment of the Quipper quantum
  programming language. We define a typed lambda calculus called Proto-Quipper which
  formalizes a restricted but expressive fragment of Quipper. The type system of Proto-Quipper
  is based on intuitionistic linear logic and prohibits the duplication of quantum
  data, in accordance with the no-cloning property of quantum computation. We prove
  that Proto-Quipper is type-safe in the sense that it enjoys the subject reduction
  and progress properties.'
