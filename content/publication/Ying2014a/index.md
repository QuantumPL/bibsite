abstract: This paper introduces a new notion of quantum recursion of which the control
  flow of the computation is quantum rather than classical as in the notions of recursion
  considered in the previous studies of quantum programming. A typical example is
  recursive quantum walks, which are obtained by slightly modifying the construction
  of the ordinary quantum walks. The operational and denotational semantics of quantum
  recursions are defined by employing the second quantisation method, and they are
  proved to be equivalent.
