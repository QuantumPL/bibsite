abstract: Quantum programming languages are essential to translate ideas into instructions
  that can be executed by a quantum computer. Not only are they crucial to the programming
  of quantum computers at scale but also they can facilitate the discovery and development
  of quantum algorithms even before hardware exists that is capable of executing them.
  Quantum programming languages are used for controlling existing physical devices,
  for estimating the execution costs of quantum algorithms on future devices, for
  teaching quantum computing concepts, or for verifying quantum algorithms and their
  implementations. They are used by newcomers and seasoned practitioners, researchers
  and developers working on the next ground-breaking discovery or applying known concepts
  to real-world problems. This variety in purpose and target audiences is reflected
  in the design and ecosystem of the existing quantum programming languages, depending
  on which factors a language prioritizes. In this Review, we highlight important
  aspects of quantum programming and how it differs from conventional programming.
  We overview a selection of several state-of-the-art quantum programming languages,
  highlight their salient features, and provide code samples for each of the languages
  and Docker files to facilitate installation of the software packages.
