abstract: Quantum computers are available to use over the cloud, but the recent explosion
  of quantum software platforms can be overwhelming for those deciding on which to
  use. In this paper, we provide a current picture of the rapidly evolving quantum
  computing landscape by comparing four software platforms - Forest (pyQuil), Qiskit,
  ProjectQ, and the Quantum Developer Kit (Q#) - that enable researchers to use real
  and simulated quantum devices. Our analysis covers requirements and installation,
  language syntax through example programs, library support, and quantum simulator
  capabilities for each platform. For platforms that have quantum computer support,
  we compare hardware, quantum assembly languages, and quantum compilers. We conclude
  by covering features of each and briefly mentioning other quantum computing software
  packages.
