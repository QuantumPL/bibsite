abstract: We present a formalization in Isabelle/HOL of quantum projective measurements,
  a class of measurements involving orthogonal projectors that is frequently used
  in quantum computing. We also formalize the CHSH inequality, a result that holds
  on arbitrary probability spaces, which can used to disprove the existence of a local
  hidden-variable theory for quantum mechanics.
