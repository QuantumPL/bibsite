abstract: We present a variant of the quantum relational Hoare logic from (Unruh,
  POPL 2019) that allows us to use "expectations" in pre- and postconditions. That
  is, when reasoning about pairs of programs, our logic allows us to quantitatively
  reason about how much certain pre-/postconditions are satisfied that refer to the
  relationship between the programs inputs/outputs.
