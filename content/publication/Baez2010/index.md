abstract: 'In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes.
  In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy
  between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much
  like a \"cobordism\": a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds
  representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory
  and \"quantum topology\". But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can
  be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where
  they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum
  computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between
  physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some
  of these analogies precise using the concept of \"closed symmetric monoidal category\".
  We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.'
