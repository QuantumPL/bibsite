abstract: In this paper we present two flavors of a quantum extension to the lambda
  calculus. The first one, 𝜆𝜌, follows the approach of classical control/quantum data,
  where the quantum data is represented by density matrices. We provide an interpretation
  for programs as density matrices and functions upon them. The second one, 𝜆∘𝜌, take
  advantage of the density matrices presentation in order to follow the mixed trace
  of programs in a kind of generalised density matrix. Such a control can be seen
  as a weaker form of the quantum control and data approach.
