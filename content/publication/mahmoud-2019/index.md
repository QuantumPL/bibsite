abstract: We develop a linear logical framework within the Hybrid system and use it
  to reason about the type system of a quantum lambda calculus. In particular, we
  consider a practical version of the calculus called Proto-Quipper, which contains
  the core of Quipper. Quipper is a quantum programming language under active development
  and recently has gained much popularity among the quantum computing communities.
  Hybrid is a system that is designed to support the use of higher-order abstract
  syntax for representing and reasoning about formal systems implemented in the Coq
  Proof Assistant. In this work, we extend the system with a linear specification
  logic (SL) in order to reason about the linear type system of Quipper. To this end,
  we formalize the semantics of Proto-Quipper by encoding the typing and evaluation
  rules in the SL, and prove type soundness.
