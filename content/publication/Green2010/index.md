abstract: This thesis looks at the development of a framework for a functional quantum
  programming language. The framework is first developed in Haskell, looking at how
  a monadic structure can be used to explicitly deal with the side-effects inherent
  in the measurement of quantum systems, and goes on to look at how a dependently-typed
  reimplementation in Agda gives us the basis for a formally verified quantum programming
  language. The two implementations are not in themselves fully developed quantum
  programming languages, as they are embedded in their respective parent languages,
  but are a major step towards the development of a full formally verified, functional
  quantum programming language. Dubbed the ``Quantum IO Monad'', this framework is
  designed following a structural approach as given by a categorical model of quantum
  computation.
