abstract: The ZX-calculus is a graphical calculus for reasoning about quantum systems
  and processes. It is known to be universal for pure state qubit quantum mechanics
  (QM), meaning any pure state, unitary operation and post-selected pure projective
  measurement can be expressed in the ZX-calculus. The calculus is also sound, i.e.
  any equality that can be derived graphically can also be derived using matrix mechanics.
  Here, we show that the ZX-calculus is complete for pure qubit stabilizer QM, meaning
  any equality that can be derived using matrices can also be derived pictorially.
  The proof relies on bringing diagrams into a normal form based on graph states and
  local Clifford operations.
