abstract: The present article gives an introductory overview of the novel field of
  quantum programming languages (QPLs) from a pragmatic perspective. First, after
  a short summary of basic notations of quantum mechanics, some of the goals and design
  issues are surveyed, which motivate the research in this area. Then, several of
  the approaches are described in more detail. The article concludes with a brief
  survey of current research activities and a tabular summary of a selection of QPLs,
  which have been published so far.
