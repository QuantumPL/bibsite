abstract: We develop a notion of predicate transformer and, in particular, the weakest
  precondition, appropriate for quantum computation. We show that there is a Stone-type
  duality between the usual state-transformer semantics and the weakest precondition
  semantics. Rather than trying to reduce quantum computation to probabilistic programming,
  we develop a notion that is directly taken from concepts used in quantum computation.
  The proof that weakest preconditions exist for completely positive maps follows
  immediately from the Kraus representation theorem. As an example, we give the semantics
  of Selinger's language in terms of our weakest preconditions. We also cover some
  specific situations and exhibit an interesting link with stabilisers.
