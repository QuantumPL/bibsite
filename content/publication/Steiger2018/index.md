abstract: We introduce ProjectQ, an open source software effort for quantum computing.
  The first release features a compiler framework capable of targeting various types
  of hardware, a high-performance simulator with emulation capabilities, and compiler
  plug-ins for circuit drawing and resource estimation. We introduce our Python-embedded
  domain-specific language, present the features, and provide example implementations
  for quantum algorithms. The framework allows testing of quantum algorithms through
  simulation and enables running them on actual quantum hardware using a back-end
  connecting to the IBM Quantum Experience cloud service. Through extension mechanisms,
  users can provide back-ends to further quantum hardware, and scientists working
  on quantum compilation can provide plug-ins for additional compilation, optimization,
  gate synthesis, and layout strategies.
