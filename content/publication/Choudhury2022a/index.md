abstract: We advance the thesis that the simulation of quantum circuits is fundamentally
  about the efficient management of a large (potentially exponential) number of delimited
  continuations. The family of Scheme languages, with its efficient implementations
  of first-class continuations and with its imperative constructs, provides an elegant
  host for modeling and simulating quantum circuits.
