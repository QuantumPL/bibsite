abstract: The field of quantum algorithms is vibrant. Still, there is currently a
  lack of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical
  scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by introducing
  Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum programming language.
  Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms,
  and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of gates. It is geared
  towards a model of computation that uses a classical computer to control a quantum
  device, but is not dependent on any particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper
  has proven effective and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods
  to analyze quantum algorithms.
