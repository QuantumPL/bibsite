abstract: 'In this chapter, we present applications of abstract interpretation techniques
  in quantum computing. Quantum computing is a now well-established domain of computer
  science, and the recent developments of semantic techniques show the vitality of
  this rapidly growing area. On the other hand, the proof has been made that abstract
  interpretation is a powerful theory (of "classical" computer science) for comparing
  more or less precise semantics of the same programming language. In a more general
  picture, abstract interpretation can be seen as a framework for comparing the precision
  of several representations of the same dynamic system evolution. In this paper,
  we point out that abstract interpretation can be fruitfully used in quantum computing:
  (i) for establishing a hierarchy of quantum semantics and (ii) for analyzing entanglement
  evolution.'
