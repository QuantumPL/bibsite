abstract: It is well-known that quantum programs are not only complicated to design
  but also challenging to verify because the quantum states can have exponential size
  and require sophisticated mathematics to encode and manipulate. To tackle the state-space
  explosion problem for quantum reasoning, we propose a Hoare-style inference framework
  that supports local reasoning for quantum programs. By providing a quantum interpretation
  of the separating conjunction, we are able to infuse separation logic into our framework
  and apply local reasoning using a quantum frame rule that is similar to the classical
  frame rule. For evaluation, we apply our framework to verify various quantum programs
  including Deutsch-Jozsa's algorithm and Grover's algorithm.
