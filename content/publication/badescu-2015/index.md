abstract: We propose a notion of quantum control in a quantum programming language
  which permits the superposition of finitely many quantum operations without performing
  a measurement. This notion takes the form of a conditional construct similar to
  the IF statement in classical programming languages. We show that adding such a
  quantum IF statement to the QPL programming language simplifies the presentation
  of several quantum algorithms. This motivates the possibility of extending the denotational
  semantics of QPL to include this form of quantum alternation. We give a denotational
  semantics for this extension of QPL based on Kraus decompositions rather than on
  superoperators. Finally, we clarify the relation between quantum alternation and
  recursion, and discuss the possibility of lifting the semantics defined by Kraus
  operators to the superoperator semantics defined by Selinger.
