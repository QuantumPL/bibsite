abstract: Modern quantum programming languages integrate quantum resources and classical
  control. They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reflect the no-cloning
  property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages
  should also support quantum circuits as first-class citizens, as well as families
  of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages
  thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper defines a general semantic structure
  for such a type theory via certain fibrations of monoidal categories. The categorical
  model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M in [28] constitutes
  an example of such a fibration, which means that the language can readily be integrated
  with dependent types. We then devise both a general linear dependent type system
  and a dependently typed extension of Proto-Quipper-M, and provide them with operational
  semantics as well as a prototype implementation.
