abstract: 'We study the two dual quantum information effects to manipulate the amount
  of information in quantum computation: hiding and allocation. The resulting type-and-effect
  system is fully expressive for irreversible quantum computing, including measurement.
  We provide universal categorical constructions that semantically interpret this
  arrow metalanguage with choice, starting with any rig groupoid interpreting the
  reversible base language. Several properties of quantum measurement follow in general,
  and we translate quantum flow charts into our language. The semantic constructions
  turn the category of unitaries between Hilbert spaces into the category of completely
  positive trace-preserving maps, and they turn the category of bijections between
  finite sets into the category of functions with chosen garbage. Thus they capture
  the fundamental theorems of classical and quantum reversible computing of Toffoli
  and Stinespring.'
