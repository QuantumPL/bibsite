abstract: Compilers and computer-aided design tools will be essential for quantum
  computing. We present a computer-aided design flow that transforms a high-level
  language program representing a quantum computing algorithm into a technology-specific
  implementation. We trace the significant steps in this flow and illustrate the transformations
  to the representation of the quantum program. The focus of this paper is on the
  languages and transformations needed to represent and optimize a quantum algorithm
  along the design flow. Our software architecture provides significant benefits to
  algorithm designers, tool builders, and experimentalists. Of particular interest
  are the trade-offs in performance and accuracy that can be obtained by weighing
  different optimization and error-correction procedures at given levels in the design
  hierarchy.
