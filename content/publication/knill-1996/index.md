abstract: A few conventions for thinking about and writing quantum pseudocode are
  proposed. The conventions can be used for presenting any quantum algorithm down
  to the lowest level and are consistent with a quantum random access machine (QRAM)
  model for quantum computing. In principle a formal version of quantum pseudocode
  could be used in a future extension of a conventional language.
