abstract: We present sqire, a low-level language for quantum computing and verification.
  sqire uses a global register of quantum bits, allowing easy compilation to and from
  existing `quantum assembly' languages and simplifying the verification process.
  We demonstrate the power of sqire as an intermediate representation of quantum programs
  by verifying a number of useful optimizations, and we demonstrate sqire's use as
  a tool for general verification by proving several quantum programs correct.
