abstract: We introduce the monoidal closed category qCPO of quantum cpos, whose objects
  are "quantized" analogs of omega-complete partial orders (cpos). The category qCPO
  is enriched over the category CPO of cpos, and contains both CPO, and the opposite
  of the category FdAlg of finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras as monoidal subcategories.
  We use qCPO to construct a sound model for the quantum programming language Proto-Quipper-M
  (PQM) extended with term recursion, as well as a sound and computationally adequate
  model for the Linear/Non-Linear Fixpoint Calculus (LNL-FPC), which is both an extension
  of the Fixpoint Calculus (FPC) with linear types, and an extension of a circuit-free
  fragment of PQM that includes recursive types.
