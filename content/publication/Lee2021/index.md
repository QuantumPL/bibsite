abstract: In this paper, we introduce dynamic lifting to a quantum circuit-description
  language, following the Proto-Quipper language approach. Dynamic lifting allows
  programs to transfer the result of measuring quantum data -- qubits -- into classical
  data -- booleans -- . We propose a type system and an operational semantics for
  the language and we state safety properties. Next, we introduce a concrete categorical
  semantics for the proposed language, basing our approach on a recent model from
  Rios&Selinger for Proto-Quipper-M. Our approach is to construct on top of a concrete
  category of circuits with measurements a Kleisli category, capturing as a side effect
  the action of retrieving classical content out of a quantum memory. We then show
  a soundness result for this semantics.
