abstract: This document describes a quantum assembly language (QASM) called OpenQASM
  that is used to implement experiments with low depth quantum circuits. OpenQASM
  represents universal physical circuits over the CNOT plus SU(2) basis with straight-line
  code that includes measurement, reset, fast feedback, and gate subroutines. The
  simple text language can be written by hand or by higher level tools and may be
  executed on the IBM Q Experience.
