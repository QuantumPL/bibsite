abstract: We explore the design space of using dependent types to type check and verify
  quantum circuits. We weigh the trade-offs between the expressivity of dependent
  types against the costs imposed by large proof terms. We propose lightweight dependent
  types, or phantom types, as a middle ground, which provide useful type information
  for programming while specifying the properties to be externally verified.
