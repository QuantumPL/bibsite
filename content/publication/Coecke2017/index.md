abstract: The unique features of the quantum world are explained in this book through
  the language of diagrams, setting out an innovative visual method for presenting
  complex theories. Requiring only basic mathematical literacy, this book employs
  a unique formalism that builds an intuitive understanding of quantum features while
  eliminating the need for complex calculations. This entirely diagrammatic presentation
  of quantum theory represents the culmination of ten years of research, uniting classical
  techniques in linear algebra and Hilbert spaces with cutting-edge developments in
  quantum computation and foundations. Written in an entertaining and user-friendly
  style and including more than one hundred exercises, this book is an ideal first
  course in quantum theory, foundations, and computation for students from undergraduate
  to PhD level, as well as an opportunity for researchers from a broad range of fields,
  from physics to biology, linguistics, and cognitive science, to discover a new set
  of tools for studying processes and interaction.
