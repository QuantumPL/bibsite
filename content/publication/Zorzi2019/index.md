abstract: In the last 20 years, several approaches to quantum programming have been
  introduced. In this survey, we focus on the QRAM (Quantum Random Access Machine)
  architectural model. We explore the twofold perspective (theoretical and concrete)
  of the approach and we list the main problems one has to face in quantum language
  design. Moreover, we propose an overview of some interesting languages and open-source
  platforms for quantum programming currently available. We also provide the higher-order
  encoding in the functional languages qPCF and IQu of the well known Deutsch-Jozsa
  and Simon's algorithms.
