abstract: 'We propose a way to unify two approaches of non-cloning in quantum lambda-calculi:
  logical and algebraic linearities. The first approach is to forbid duplicating variables,
  while the second is to consider all lambda-terms as algebraic-linear functions.
  We illustrate this idea by defining a quantum extension of first-order simply-typed
  lambda-calculus, where the type is linear on superposition, while allows cloning
  base vectors. In addition, we provide an interpretation of the calculus where superposed
  types are interpreted as vector spaces and non-superposed types as their basis.'
