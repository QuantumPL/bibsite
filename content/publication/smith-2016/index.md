abstract: We introduce an abstract machine architecture for classical/quantum computations---including
  compilation---along with a quantum instruction language called Quil for explicitly
  writing these computations. With this formalism, we discuss concrete implementations
  of the machine and non-trivial algorithms targeting them. The introduction of this
  machine dovetails with ongoing development of quantum computing technology, and
  makes possible portable descriptions of recent classical/quantum algorithms.
