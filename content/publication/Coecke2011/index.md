abstract: 'This paper has two tightly intertwined aims: (i) to introduce an intuitive
  and universal graphical calculus for multi-qubit systems, the ZX-calculus, which
  greatly simplifies derivations in the area of quantum computation and information.
  (ii) To axiomatize complementarity of quantum observables within a general framework
  for physical theories in terms of dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We also
  axiomatize phase shifts within this framework. Using the well-studied canonical
  correspondence between graphical calculi and dagger symmetric monoidal categories,
  our results provide a purely graphical formalisation of complementarity for quantum
  observables. Each individual observable, represented by a commutative special dagger
  Frobenius algebra, gives rise to an Abelian group of phase shifts, which we call
  the phase group. We also identify a strong form of complementarity, satisfied by
  the Z- and X-spin observables, which yields a scaled variant of a bialgebra.'
