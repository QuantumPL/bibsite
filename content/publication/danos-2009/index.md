abstract: "Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) has emerged as a new approach\
  \ to quantum computation where the notion of measurement is the main driving force\
  \ of computation. This is in contrast with the more traditional circuit model that\
  \ takes unitary operations as fundamental. Among measurement-based quantum computation\
  \ methods the recently introduced one-way quantum computer stands out as basic and\
  \ fundamental. The key idea is to start from an entangled state and then use measurements\
  \ and one-qubit unitaries, which may be dependent on the outcomes of measurements,\
  \ to guide the computation. The main point is that one never has to perform unitaries\
  \ on more than one qubit at a time after the initial preparation of an entangled\
  \ state. The ``programs'' that one writes in this model are traditionally called\
  \ ``patterns.''In this chapter, we develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying\
  \ measurement-based quantum computation. We give syntax, operational semantics,\
  \ denotational semantics, and an algebra of programs derived from the denotational\
  \ semantics. We also present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization\
  \ theorem that allows all programs to be put in a semantically equivalent standard\
  \ form. Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture\
  \ based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by\
  \ exposing the dependency structure of measurements, and expressiveness theorems.We\
  \ use our general measurement calculus not just to formalize the one-way model but\
  \ also several other measurement-based models, e.g., Teleportation, Phase, and Pauli\
  \ models, and present compositional embeddings of them into and from the one-way\
  \ model."
