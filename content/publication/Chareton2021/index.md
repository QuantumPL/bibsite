abstract: "While recent progress in quantum hardware open the door for significant\
  \ speedup in certain key areas, quantum algorithms are still hard to implement right,\
  \ and the validation of such quantum programs is a challenge. In this paper we propose\
  \ Qbricks, a formal verification environment for circuit-building quantum programs,\
  \ featuring both parametric specifications and a high degree of proof automation.\
  \ We propose a logical framework based on first-order logic, and develop the main\
  \ tool we rely upon for achieving the automation of proofs of quantum specification:\
  \ PPS, a parametric extension of the recently developed path sum semantics. To back-up\
  \ our claims, we implement and verify parametric versions of several famous and\
  \ non-trivial quantum algorithms, including the quantum parts of Shor's integer\
  \ factoring, quantum phase estimation (QPE) and Grover's search."
