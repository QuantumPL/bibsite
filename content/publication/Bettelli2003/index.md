abstract: 'It is becoming increasingly clear that, if a useful device for quantum
  computation will ever be built, it will be embodied by a classical computing machine
  with control over a truly quantum subsystem, this apparatus performing a mixture
  of classical and quantum computation. This paper investigates a possible approach
  to the problem of programming such machines: a template high level quantum language
  is presented which complements a generic general purpose classical language with
  a set of quantum primitives. The underlying scheme involves a run-time environment
  which calculates the byte-code for the quantum operations and pipes it to a quantum
  device controller or to a simulator. This language can compactly express existing
  quantum algorithms and reduce them to sequences of elementary operations; it also
  easily lends itself to automatic, hardware independent, circuit simplification.
  A publicly available preliminary implementation of the proposed ideas has been realised
  using the language.'
