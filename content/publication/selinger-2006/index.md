abstract: In this paper we develop a functional programming language for quantum computers
  by extending the simply-typed lambda calculus with quantum types and operations.
  The design of this language adheres to the `quantum data, classical control' paradigm,
  following the first author's work on quantum flow-charts. We define a call-by-value
  operational semantics, and give a type system using affine intuitionistic linear
  logic. The main results of this paper are the safety properties of the language
  and the development of a type inference algorithm.
