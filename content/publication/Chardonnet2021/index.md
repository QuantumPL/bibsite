abstract: ZX-Calculus is a versatile graphical language for quantum computation equipped
  with an equational theory. Getting inspiration from Geometry of Interaction, in
  this paper we propose a token-machine-based asynchronous model of both pure ZX-Calculus
  and its extension to mixed processes. We also show how to connect this new semantics
  to the usual standard interpretation of ZX-diagrams. This model allows us to have
  a new look at what ZX-diagrams compute, and give a more local, operational view
  of the semantics of ZX-diagrams.
