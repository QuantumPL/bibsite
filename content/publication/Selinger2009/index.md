abstract: We discuss the design of a typed lambda calculus for quantum computation.
  After a brief discussion of the role of higher-order functions in quantum information
  theory, we define the quantum lambda calculus and its operational semantics. Safety
  invariants, such as the no-cloning property, are enforced by a static type system
  that is based on intuitionistic linear logic. We also describe a type inference
  algorithm, and a categorical semantics.
