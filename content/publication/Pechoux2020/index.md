abstract: Inductive datatypes in programming languages allow users to define useful
  data structures such as natural numbers, lists, trees, and others. In this paper
  we show how inductive datatypes may be added to the quantum programming language
  QPL. We construct a sound categorical model for the language and by doing so we
  provide the first detailed semantic treatment of user-defined inductive datatypes
  in quantum programming. We also show our denotational interpretation is invariant
  with respect to big-step reduction, thereby establishing another novel result for
  quantum programming. Compared to classical programming, this property is considerably
  more difficult to prove and we demonstrate its usefulness by showing how it immediately
  implies computational adequacy at all types. To further cement our results, our
  semantics is entirely based on a physically natural model of von Neumann algebras,
  which are mathematical structures used by physicists to study quantum mechanics.
