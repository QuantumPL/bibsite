abstract: We present qcorâ€”a language extension to C++ and compiler implementation
  that enables heterogeneous quantum-classical programming, compilation, and execution
  in a single-source context. Our work provides a first-of-its-kind C++ compiler enabling
  high-level quantum kernel (function) expression in a quantum-language agnostic manner,
  as well as a hardware-agnostic, retargetable compiler workflow targeting a number
  of physical and virtual quantum computing backends. qcor leverages novel Clang plugin
  interfaces and builds upon the XACC system-level quantum programming framework to
  provide a state-of-the-art integration mechanism for quantum-classical compilation
  that leverages the best from the community at-large. qcor translates quantum kernels
  ultimately to the XACC intermediate representation, and provides user-extensible
  hooks for quantum compilation routines like circuit optimization, analysis, and
  placement. This work details the overall architecture and compiler workflow for
  qcor, and provides a number of illuminating programming examples demonstrating its
  utility for near-term variational tasks, quantum algorithm expression, and feed-forward
  error correction schemes.
