abstract: Quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum computation and
  communication. It is necessary for many protocols and computations, but causes unexpected
  disturbance of computational states. Hence, static analysis of quantum entanglement
  in quantum programs is necessary. Several papers studied the problem. They decided
  qubits were entangled if multiple qubits unitary gates are applied to them, and
  some refined this reasoning using information about the state of each separated
  qubit. However, they do not care about the fact that unitary gate undoes entanglement
  and that measurement may separate multiple qubits. In this paper, we extend prior
  work using stabilizer formalism. It refines reasoning about separability of quantum
  variables in quantum programs.
