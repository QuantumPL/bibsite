abstract: We present t$|$ket$\rangle$, a quantum software development platform produced
  by Cambridge Quantum Computing Ltd. The heart of t$|$ket$\rangle$ is a language-agnostic
  optimising compiler designed to generate code for a variety of NISQ devices, which
  has several features designed to minimise the influence of device error. The compiler
  has been extensively benchmarked and outperforms most competitors in terms of circuit
  optimisation and qubit routing.
