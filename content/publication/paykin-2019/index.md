abstract: This paper presents an equational theory for the QRAM model of quantum computation,
  formulated as an embedded language inside of homotopy type theory. The embedded
  language approach is highly expressive, and reflects the style of state-of-the art
  quantum languages like Quipper and QWIRE. The embedding takes advantage of features
  of homotopy type theory to encode unitary transformations as higher inductive paths,
  simplifying the presentation of an equational theory. We prove that this equational
  theory is sound and complete with respect to established models of quantum computation.
