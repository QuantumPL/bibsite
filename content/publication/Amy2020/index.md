abstract: We describe staq, a full-stack quantum processing toolkit written in standard
  C++. staq is a quantum compiler toolkit, comprising of tools that range from quantum
  optimizers and translators to physical mappers for quantum devices with restricted
  connectives. The design of staq is inspired from the UNIX philosophy of `less is
  more', i.e. staq achieves complex functionality via combining (piping) small tools,
  each of which performs a single task using the most advanced current state-of-the-art
  methods. We also provide a set of illustrative benchmarks.
