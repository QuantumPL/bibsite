abstract: Compilers and computer-aided design tools are essential for fine-grained
  control of nanoscale quantum-mechanical systems. A proposed four-phase design flow
  assists with computations by transforming a quantum algorithm from a high-level
  language program into precisely scheduled physical actions.
