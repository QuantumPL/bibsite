abstract: Over the past 27 years, quantum computing has seen a huge rise in interest
  from both academia and industry. At the current rate, quantum computers are growing
  in size rapidly backed up by the increase of research in the field. Significant
  efforts are being made to improve the reliability of quantum hardware and to develop
  suitable software to program quantum computers. In contrast, the verification of
  quantum programs has received relatively less attention. The importance of verifying
  programs is especially important in the quantum setting due to how difficult it
  is to program complex algorithms correctly on resource-constrained and error-prone
  quantum hardware. Research into creating verification frameworks for quantum programs
  has seen recent development, with a variety of tools implemented using a collection
  of theoretical ideas. This survey aims to be a short introduction into the area
  of formal verification of quantum programs, bringing together theory and tools developed
  to date. Further, this survey examines some of the challenges that the field may
  face in the future, namely the developments of complex quantum algorithms.
