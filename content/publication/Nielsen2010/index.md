abstract: One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum Computation
  and Quantum Information remains the best textbook in this exciting field of science.
  This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting
  the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects
  as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum
  error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving
  on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems
  faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes
  with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures
  and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and
  will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science,
  mathematics, and electrical engineering.
