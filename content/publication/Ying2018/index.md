abstract: "We initiate the study of parallel quantum programming by defining the operational\
  \ and denotational semantics of parallel quantum programs. The technical contributions\
  \ of this paper include: (1) find a series of useful proof rules for reasoning about\
  \ correctness of parallel quantum programs; (2) prove a (relative) completeness\
  \ of our proof rules for partial correctness of disjoint parallel quantum programs;\
  \ and (3) prove a strong soundness theorem of the proof rules showing that partial\
  \ correctness is well maintained at each step of transitions in the operational\
  \ semantics of a general parallel quantum program (with shared variables). This\
  \ is achieved by partially overcoming the following conceptual challenges that are\
  \ never present in classical parallel programming: (i) the intertwining of nondeterminism\
  \ caused by quantum measurements and introduced by parallelism; (ii) entanglement\
  \ between component quantum programs; and (iii) combining quantum predicates in\
  \ the overlap of state Hilbert spaces of component quantum programs with shared\
  \ variables. Applications of the techniques developed in this paper are illustrated\
  \ by a formal verification of Bravyi-Gosset-KÃ¶nig's parallel quantum algorithm solving\
  \ a linear algebra problem, which gives for the first time an unconditional proof\
  \ of a computational quantum advantage."
