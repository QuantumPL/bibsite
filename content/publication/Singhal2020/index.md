abstract: We describe the ongoing development of a verified translator between OpenQASM
  (Open Quantum Assembly Language) and sqir, a Small Quantum Intermediate Representation
  used for circuit optimization. Verified translation from and to OpenQASM will allow
  verified optimization of circuits written in a variety of tools and executed on
  real quantum computers. This translator is a step toward a verified compilation
  stack for quantum computing.
