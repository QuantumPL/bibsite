abstract: We introduce dependently typed Proto-Quipper, or Proto-Quipper-D for short,
  an experimental quantum circuit programming language with linear dependent types.
  We give several examples to illustrate how linear dependent types can help in the
  construction of correct quantum circuits. Specifically, we show how dependent types
  enable programming families of circuits, and how dependent types solve the problem
  of type-safe uncomputation of garbage qubits. We also discuss other language features
  along the way.
