abstract: We present IQu, namely a quantum programming language that extends Reynold's
  Idealized Algol, the paradigmatic core of Algol-like languages. IQu combines imperative
  programming with high-order features, mediated by a simple type theory. IQu mildly
  merges its quantum features with the classical programming style that we can experiment
  through Idealized Algol, the aim being to ease a transition towards the quantum
  programming world. The proposed extension is done along two main directions. First,
  IQu makes the access to quantum co-processors by means of quantum stores. Second,
  IQu includes some support for the direct manipulation of quantum circuits, in accordance
  with recent trends in the development of quantum programming languages. Finally,
  we show that IQu is quite effective in expressing well-known quantum algorithms.
