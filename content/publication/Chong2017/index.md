abstract: Quantum computing sits at an important inflection point. For years, high-level
  algorithms for quantum computers have shown considerable promise, and recent advances
  in quantum device fabrication offer hope of utility. A gap still exists, however,
  between the hardware size and reliability requirements of quantum computing algorithms
  and the physical machines foreseen within the next ten years. To bridge this gap,
  quantum computers require appropriate software to translate and optimize applications
  (toolflows) and abstraction layers. Given the stringent resource constraints in
  quantum computing, information passed between layers of software and implementations
  will differ markedly from in classical computing. Quantum toolflows must expose
  more physical details between layers, so the challenge is to find abstractions that
  expose key details while hiding enough complexity.
