abstract: We introduce a Geometry of Interaction model for higher-order quantum computation,
  and prove its adequacy for a fully fledged quantum programming language in which
  entanglement, duplication, and recursion are all available. This model is an instance
  of a new framework which captures not only quantum but also classical and probabilistic
  computation. Its main feature is the ability to model commutative effects in a parallel
  setting. Our model comes with a multi-token machine, a proof net system, and a -style
  language. Being based on a multi-token machine equipped with a memory, it has a
  concrete nature which makes it well suited for building low-level operational descriptions
  of higher-order languages.
