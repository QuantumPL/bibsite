abstract: "We study quantum information and computation from a novel point of view.\
  \ Our approach is based on recasting the standard axiomatic presentation of quantum\
  \ mechanics, due to von Neumann, at a more abstract level, of compact closed categories\
  \ with biproducts. We show how the essential structures found in key quantum information\
  \ protocols such as teleportation, logic-gate teleportation, and entanglement-swapping\
  \ can be captured at this abstract level. Moreover, from the combination of the\
  \ --apparently purely qualitative-- structures of compact closure and biproducts\
  \ there emerge `scalars` and a `Born rule'. This abstract and structural point of\
  \ view opens up new possibilities for describing and reasoning about quantum systems.\
  \ It also shows the degrees of axiomatic freedom: we can show what requirements\
  \ are placed on the (semi)ring of scalars C(I,I), where C is the category and I\
  \ is the tensor unit, in order to perform various protocols such as teleportation.\
  \ Our formalism captures both the information-flow aspect of the protocols (see\
  \ quant-ph/0402014), and the branching due to quantum indeterminism. This contrasts\
  \ with the standard accounts, in which the classical information flows are `outside'\
  \ the usual quantum-mechanical formalism."
