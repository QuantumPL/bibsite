abstract: 'We survey the landscape of Hoare logics for quantum programs. We review
  three papers: \"Reasoning about imperative quantum programs\" by Chadha, Mateus
  and Sernadas; \"A logic for formal verification of quantum programs\" by Yoshihiko
  Kakutani; and \"Floyd-hoare logic for quantum programs\" by Mingsheng Ying. We compare
  the mathematical foundations of the logics, their underlying languages, and the
  expressivity of their assertions. We also use the languages to verify the Deutsch-Jozsa
  Algorithm, and discuss their relative usability in practice.'
