abstract: We propose a categorical foundation for the connection between pure and
  mixed states in quantum information and quantum computation. The foundation is based
  on distributive monoidal categories. First, we prove that the category of all quantum
  channels is a canonical completion of the category of pure quantum operations (with
  ancilla preparations). More precisely, we prove that the category of completely
  positive trace-preserving maps between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a canonical
  completion of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces and isometries. Second,
  we extend our result to give a foundation to the topological relationships between
  quantum channels. We do this by generalizing our categorical foundation to the topologically-enriched
  setting. In particular, we show that the operator norm topology on quantum channels
  is the canonical topology induced by the norm topology on isometries.
