abstract: We propose a model of the substructural logic of Bunched Implications (BI)
  that is suitable for reasoning about quantum states. In our model, the separating
  conjunction of BI describes separable quantum states. We develop a program logic
  where pre- and post-conditions are BI formulas describing quantum states---the program
  logic can be seen as a counterpart of separation logic for imperative quantum programs.
  We exercise the logic for proving the security of quantum one-time pad and secret
  sharing, and we show how the program logic can be used to discover a flaw in Google
  Cirq's tutorial on the Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA).
