abstract: Quantum computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement
  to realize a form of parallelism that is not available to traditional computing.
  It offers the potential of significant computational speed-ups in quantum chemistry,
  materials science, cryptography, and machine learning. The dominant approach to
  programming quantum computers is to provide an existing high-level language with
  libraries that allow for the expression of quantum programs. This approach can permit
  computations that are meaningless in a quantum context; prohibits succint expression
  of interaction between classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important
  constructs that are required for quantum programming. We present Q#, a quantum-focused
  domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and completely
  express quantum algorithms. Q# provides a type system; a tightly constrained environment
  to safely interleave classical and quantum computations; specialized syntax; symbolic
  code manipulation to automatically generate correct transformations of quantum operations;
  and powerful functional constructs which aid composition.
