abstract: Floyd--Hoare logic is a foundation of axiomatic semantics of classical programs,
  and it provides effective proof techniques for reasoning about correctness of classical
  programs. To offer similar techniques for quantum program verification and to build
  a logical foundation of programming methodology for quantum computers, we develop
  a full-fledged Floyd--Hoare logic for both partial and total correctness of quantum
  programs. It is proved that this logic is (relatively) complete by exploiting the
  power of weakest preconditions and weakest liberal preconditions for quantum programs.
