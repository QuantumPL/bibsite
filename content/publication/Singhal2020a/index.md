abstract: As quantum computers become real, it is high time we come up with effective
  techniques that help programmers write correct quantum programs. Inspired by Hoare
  Type Theory in classical computing, we propose Quantum Hoare Type Theory (QHTT),
  in which precise specifications about the modification to the quantum state can
  be provided within the type of computation. These specifications within a Hoare
  type are given in the form of Hoare-logic style pre- and postconditions following
  the propositions-as-types principle. The type-checking process verifies that the
  implementation conforms to the provided specification. QHTT has the potential to
  be a unified system for programming, specifying, and reasoning about quantum programs.
