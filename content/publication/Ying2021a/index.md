abstract: In this paper, we define the operational and denotational semantics of a
  special class of parallel quantum programs, namely disjoint parallel quantum programs.
  Based on them, a proof system for reasoning about disjoint parallel quantum programs
  is developed, which is (relatively) complete even when entanglement between different
  processes appears in the preconditions and postconditions.
