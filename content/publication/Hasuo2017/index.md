abstract: While much of the current study on quantum computation employs low-level
  formalisms such as quantum circuits, several high-level languages/calculi have been
  recently proposed aiming at structured quantum programming. The current work contributes
  to the semantical study of such languages by providing interaction-based semantics
  of a functional quantum programming language; the latter is, much like Selinger
  and Valiron's, based on linear lambda calculus and equipped with features like the
  ! modality and recursion. The proposed denotational model is the first one that
  supports the full features of a quantum functional programming language; we prove
  adequacy of our semantics. The construction of our model is by a series of existing
  techniques taken from the semantics of classical computation as well as from process
  theory. The most notable among them is Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI), categorically
  formulated by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott. The mathematical genericity of these
  techniques—largely due to their categorical formulation—is exploited for our move
  from classical to quantum.
