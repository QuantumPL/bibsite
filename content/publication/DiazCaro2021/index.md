abstract: We investigate an unsuspected connection between non-harmonious logical
  connectives, such as Prior's tonk, and quantum computing. We argue that non-harmonious
  connectives model the information erasure, the non-reversibility, and the non-determinism
  that occur, among other places, in quantum measurement. We introduce a propositional
  logic with a non-harmonious connective sup and show that its proof language forms
  the core of a quantum programming language.
