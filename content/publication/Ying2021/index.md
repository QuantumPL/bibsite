abstract: Model checking is one of the most successful verification techniques and
  has been widely adopted in traditional computing and communication hardware and
  software industries. This book provides the first systematic introduction to model
  checking techniques applicable to quantum systems, with broad potential applications
  in the emerging industry of quantum computing and quantum communication as well
  as quantum physics. Suitable for use as a course textbook and for self-study, graduate
  and senior undergraduate students will appreciate the step-by-step explanations
  and the exercises included. Researchers and engineers in the related fields can
  further develop these techniques in their own work, with the final chapter outlining
  potential future applications.
