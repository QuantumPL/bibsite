abstract: We propose a way to unify two approaches of non-cloning in quantum lambda-calculi.
  The first approach is to forbid duplicating variables, while the second is to consider
  all lambda-terms as algebraic-linear functions. We illustrate this idea by defining
  a quantum extension of first-order simply-typed lambda-calculus, where the type
  is linear on superposition, while allows cloning base vectors. In addition, we provide
  an interpretation of the calculus where superposed types are interpreted as vector
  spaces and non-superposed types as their basis.
