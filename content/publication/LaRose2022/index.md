abstract: We introduce Mitiq, a Python package for error mitigation on noisy quantum
  computers. Error mitigation techniques can reduce the impact of noise on near-term
  quantum computers with minimal overhead in quantum resources by relying on a mixture
  of quantum sampling and classical post-processing techniques. Mitiq is an extensible
  toolkit of different error mitigation methods, including zero-noise extrapolation,
  probabilistic error cancellation, and Clifford data regression. The library is designed
  to be compatible with generic backends and interfaces with different quantum software
  frameworks. We describe Mitiq using code snippets to demonstrate usage and discuss
  features and contribution guidelines. We present several examples demonstrating
  error mitigation on IBM and Rigetti superconducting quantum processors as well as
  on noisy simulators.
