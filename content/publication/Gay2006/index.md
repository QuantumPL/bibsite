abstract: The field of quantum programming languages is developing rapidly and there
  is a surprisingly large literature. Research in this area includes the design of
  programming languages for quantum computing, the application of established semantic
  and logical techniques to the foundations of quantum mechanics, and the design of
  compilers for quantum programming languages. This article justifies the study of
  quantum programming languages, presents the basics of quantum computing, surveys
  the literature in quantum programming languages, and indicates directions for future
  research.
