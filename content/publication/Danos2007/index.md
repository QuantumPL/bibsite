abstract: 'Measurement-based quantum computation has emerged from the physics community
  as a new approach to quantum computation where the notion of measurement is the
  main driving force of computation. This is in contrast with the more traditional
  circuit model that is based on unitary operations. Among measurement-based quantum
  computation methods, the recently introduced one-way quantum computer [Raussendorf
  and Briegel 2001] stands out as fundamental. We develop a rigorous mathematical
  model underlying the one-way quantum computer and present a concrete syntax and
  operational semantics for programs, which we call patterns, and an algebra of these
  patterns derived from a denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus
  for reasoning locally and compositionally about these patterns. We present a rewrite
  theory and prove a general standardization theorem which allows all patterns to
  be put in a semantically equivalent standard form. Standardization has far-reaching
  consequences: a new physical architecture based on performing all the entanglement
  in the beginning, parallelization by exposing the dependency structure of measurements
  and expressiveness theorems. Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based
  models, for example, Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional
  embeddings of them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all
  the theory we develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the
  framework we have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation
  and is not just particular to the one-way quantum computer.'
