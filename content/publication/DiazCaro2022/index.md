abstract: In this short overview, we start with the basics of quantum computing, explaining
  the difference between the quantum and the classical control paradigms. We give
  an overview of the quantum control line of research within the lambda calculus,
  ranging from untyped calculi up to categorical and realisability models. This is
  a summary of the last 10+ years of research in this area, starting from Arrighi
  and Dowek's seminal work until today.
