abstract: Quantum computing technology may soon deliver revolutionary improvements
  in algorithmic performance, but these are only useful if computed answers are correct.
  While hardware-level decoherence errors have garnered significant attention, a less
  recognized obstacle to correctness is that of human programming errors -- "bugs".
  Techniques familiar to most programmers from the classical domain for avoiding,
  discovering, and diagnosing bugs do not easily transfer, at scale, to the quantum
  domain because of its unique characteristics. To address this problem, we have been
  working to adapt formal methods to quantum programming. With such methods, a programmer
  writes a mathematical specification alongside their program, and semi-automatically
  proves the program correct with respect to it. The proof's validity is automatically
  confirmed -- certified -- by a "proof assistant". Formal methods have successfully
  yielded high-assurance classical software artifacts, and the underlying technology
  has produced certified proofs of major mathematical theorems. As a demonstration
  of the feasibility of applying formal methods to quantum programming, we present
  the first formally certified end-to-end implementation of Shor's prime factorization
  algorithm, developed as part of a novel framework for applying the certified approach
  to general applications. By leveraging our framework, one can significantly reduce
  the effects of human errors and obtain a high-assurance implementation of large-scale
  quantum applications in a principled way.
