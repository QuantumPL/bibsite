abstract: Finding a denotational semantics for higher order quantum computation is
  a long-standing problem in the semantics of quantum programming languages. Most
  past approaches to this problem fell short in one way or another, either limiting
  the language to an unusably small finitary fragment, or giving up important features
  of quantum physics such as entanglement. In this paper, we propose a denotational
  semantics for a quantum lambda calculus with recursion and an infinite data type,
  using constructions from quantitative semantics of linear logic.
