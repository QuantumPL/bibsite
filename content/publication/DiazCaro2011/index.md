abstract: "This paper demonstrates how to add a measurement operator to quantum λ-calculi.\
  \ A proof of the consistency of the semantics is given through a proof of confluence\
  \ presented in a sufficiently general way to allow this technique to be used for\
  \ other languages. The method described here may be applied to probabilistic rewrite\
  \ systems in general, and to add measurement to more complex languages such as QML\
