abstract: 'We formalise the constructive content of an essential feature of quantum
  mechanics: the interaction of complementary quantum observables, and information
  flow mediated by them. Using a general categorical formulation, we show that pairs
  of mutually unbiased quantum observables form bialgebra-like structures. We also
  provide an abstract account on the quantum data encoded in complex phases, and prove
  a normal form theorem for it. Together these enable us to describe all observables
  of finite dimensional Hilbert space quantum mechanics. The resulting equations suffice
  to perform computations with elementary quantum gates, translate between distinct
  quantum computational models, establish the equivalence of entangled quantum states,
  and simulate quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform. All these
  computations moreover happen within an intuitive diagrammatic calculus.'
