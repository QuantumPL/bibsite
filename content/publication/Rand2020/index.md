abstract: The Heisenberg representation of quantum operators provides a powerful technique
  for reasoning about quantum circuits, albeit those restricted to the common (non-universal)
  Clifford set H, S and CNOT. The Gottesman-Knill theorem showed that we can use this
  representation to efficiently simulate Clifford circuits. We show that Gottesman's
  semantics for quantum programs can be treated as a type system, allowing us to efficiently
  characterize a common subset of quantum programs. We also show that it can be extended
  beyond the Clifford set to partially characterize a broad range of programs. We
  apply these types to reason about separable states and the superdense coding algorithm.
