abstract: qPCF is a paradigmatic quantum programming language that extends PCF with
  quantum circuits and a quantum co-processor. Quantum circuits are treated as classical
  data that can be duplicated and manipulated in flexible ways by means of a dependent
  type system. The co-processor is essentially a standard QRAM device, albeit we avoid
  to store permanently quantum states in between two co-processor's calls. Despite
  its quantum features, qPCF retains the classic programming approach of PCF. We introduce
  qPCF syntax, typing rules, and its operational semantics. We prove fundamental syntactic
  properties of the system. Moreover, we provide some higher-order examples of circuit
  encoding.
