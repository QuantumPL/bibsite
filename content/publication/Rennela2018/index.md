abstract: We describe categorical models of a circuit-based (quantum) functional programming
  language. We show that enriched categories play a crucial role. Following earlier
  work on QWire by Paykin et al., we consider both a simple first-order linear language
  for circuits, and a more powerful host language, such that the circuit language
  is embedded inside the host language. Our categorical semantics for the host language
  is standard, and involves cartesian closed categories and monads. We interpret the
  circuit language not in an ordinary category, but in a category that is enriched
  in the host category. As an extended example, we recall an earlier result that the
  category of W*-algebras is dcpo-enriched, and we use this model to extend the circuit
  language with some recursive types.
