abstract: In this paper we present a semantics for a linear algebraic lambda-calculus
  based on realizability. This semantics characterizes a notion of unitarity in the
  system, answering a long standing issue. We derive from the semantics a set of typing
  rules for a simply-typed linear algebraic lambda-calculus, and show how it extends
  both to classical and quantum lambda-calculi.
