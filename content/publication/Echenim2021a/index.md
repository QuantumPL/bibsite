abstract: This work contains a formalization of quantum projective measurements, also
  known as von Neumann measurements, which are based on elements of spectral theory.
  We also formalized the CHSH inequality, an inequality involving expectations in
  a probability space that is violated by quantum measurements, thus proving that
  quantum mechanics cannot be modeled with an underlying local hidden-variable theory.
