abstract: "This chapter presents a systematic exposition of predicate transformer\
  \ semantics for quantum programs. It is divided into two parts: The first part reviews\
  \ the state transformer (forward) semantics of quantum programs according to Selinger's\
  \ suggestion of representing quantum programs by superoperators and elucidates D'Hondt-Panangaden's\
  \ theory of quantum weakest preconditions in detail. In the second part, we develop\
  \ a quite complete predicate transformer semantics of quantum programs based on\
  \ Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic by considering only quantum predicates expressed\
  \ by projection operators. In particular, the universal conjunctivity and termination\
  \ law of quantum programs are proved, and Hoare's induction rule is established\
  \ in the quantum setting."
