abstract: 'One perspective on quantum algorithms is that they are classical algorithms
  having access to a special kind of memory with exotic properties. This perspective
  suggests that, even in the case of quantum algorithms, the control flow notions
  of sequencing, conditionals, loops, and recursion are entirely classical. There
  is however, another notion of control flow, that is itself quantum. The notion of
  quantum conditional expression is reasonably well-understood: the execution of the
  two expressions becomes itself a superposition of executions. The quantum counterpart
  of loops and recursion is however not believed to be meaningful in its most general
  form.'
