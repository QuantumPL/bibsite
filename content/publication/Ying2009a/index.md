abstract: Hoare logic is a foundation of axiomatic semantics of classical programs
  and it provides effective proof techniques for reasoning about correctness of classical
  programs. To offer similar techniques for quantum program verification and to build
  a logical foundation of programming methodology for quantum computers, we develop
  a full-fledged Hoare logic for both partial and total correctness of quantum programs.
  It is proved that this logic is (relatively) complete by exploiting the power of
  weakest preconditions and weakest liberal preconditions for quantum programs.
