abstract: Quipper is a recently developed programming language for expressing quantum
  computations. This paper gives a brief tutorial introduction to the language, through
  a demonstration of how to make use of some of its key features. We illustrate many
  of Quipper's language features by developing a few well known examples of Quantum
  computation, including quantum teleportation, the quantum Fourier transform, and
  a quantum circuit for addition.
