abstract: We argue that notions in quantum theory should have universal properties
  in the sense of category theory. We consider the completely positive trace preserving
  (CPTP) maps, the basic notion of quantum channel. Physically, quantum channels are
  derived from pure quantum theory by allowing discarding. We phrase this in category
  theoretic terms by showing that the category of CPTP maps is the universal monoidal
  category with a terminal unit that has a functor from the category of isometries.
  In other words, the CPTP maps are the affine reflection of the isometries.
