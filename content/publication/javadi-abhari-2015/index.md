abstract: We present ScaffCC, a scalable compilation and analysis framework based
  on LLVM (Lattner and Adve, 2004), which can be used for compiling quantum computing
  applications at the logical level. Drawing upon mature compiler technologies, we
  discuss similarities and differences between compilation of classical and quantum
  programs, and adapt our methods to optimizing the compilation time and output for
  the quantum case. Our work also integrates a reversible-logic synthesis tool in
  the compiler to facilitate coding of quantum circuits. Lastly, we present some useful
  quantum program analysis scenarios and discuss their implications, specifically
  with an elaborate discussion of timing analysis for critical path estimation. Our
  work focuses on bridging the gap between high-level quantum algorithm specifications
  and low-level physical implementations, while providing good scalability to larger
  and more interesting problems.
