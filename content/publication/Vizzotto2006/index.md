abstract: 'We show that the model of quantum computation based on density matrices
  and superoperators can be decomposed into a pure classical (functional) part and
  an effectful part modelling probabilities and measurement. The effectful part can
  be modelled using a generalisation of monads called arrows. We express the resulting
  executable model of quantum computing in the Haskell programming language using
  its special syntax for arrow computations. However, the embedding in Haskell is
  not perfect: a faithful model of quantum computing requires type capabilities that
  are not directly expressible in Haskell.'
