abstract: Linear/non-linear (LNL) models, as described by Benton, soundly model a
  LNL term calculus and LNL logic closely related to intuitionistic linear logic.
  Every such model induces a canonical enrichment that we show soundly models a LNL
  lambda calculus for string diagrams, introduced by Rios and Selinger (with primary
  application in quantum computing). Our abstract treatment of this language leads
  to simpler concrete models compared to those presented so far. We also extend the
  language with general recursion and prove soundness. Finally, we present an adequacy
  result for the diagram-free fragment of the language which corresponds to a modified
  version of Benton and Wadler's adjoint calculus with recursion.
