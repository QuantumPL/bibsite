Since the [last news item](../gh-org-ui/) in July, there have been several visual and usability improvements to this QPL Bib. I list the major ones here:

- The menu bar of the site includes several new pages:
  - [an About page](../../about)
  - two indices:
     -  [Authors](../../authors) sorted alphabetically
     -  [Keywords/Tags](../../tags) sorted by both usage and alphabetically
  - two other renderings of the same bibliography:
    - [Retro](../../retro/bbt.html) (generated by `bibtex2html`)
    - [BibBase](../../base)
- We now have [a tag cloud](../../#tags) at the bottom of the home page.
- The bibliography has grown to almost 125 publications! We started with just about 50.
- Apart from old papers, I continue to add preprints of papers at upcoming conferences as soon as they become available. [An example](../../publication/Heunen2022/).
- We have a new short URL: [git.io/qpl-bib](https://git.io/qpl-bib).
- There is a new [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/QuantumPL/bib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- There is some progress on [grouping papers by subareas](https://github.com/QuantumPL/bib/issues/2):
  - a new publication type for [software](../..//publication/#9).
  - two new categories:
    - [Surveys](../../category/Survey)
    - [PhD Dissertations](../../category/PhD-Thesis/)
- [Various](https://github.com/QuantumPL/bib/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2021) other [issues](https://github.com/QuantumPL/site/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2021) tracked on GitHub have been resolved.
- The bibentries themselves have been [normalized](https://github.com/QuantumPL/bib/search?q=normalize&type=commits) in [several](https://github.com/QuantumPL/bib/search?q=canonical&type=commits) ways.
- We have a new site favicon courtesy of [lastspark from the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/term/quantum-computer/1697151/).

Other minor changes get incorporated as I notice issues ([see GitHub](https://github.com/QuantumPL/bib/commits/main)). Your [contributions](https://github.com/QuantumPL/bib/issues) are most welcome as usual.

Thanks to [Robert Rand](../../author/Robert-Rand), [Mingsheng Ying](../../author/Mingsheng-Ying), [Dongho Lee](../../author/Dongho-Lee), [Matt Amy](../../author/Matthew-Amy), and [Sam Staton](../../author/Sam-Staton) for their suggestions in helping improve this community resource.

I wish everyone a Happy New Year 2022!
